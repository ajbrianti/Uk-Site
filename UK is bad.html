    <h1> Why The UK left the EU </h1>
    <h2>And their currency declined</h2> 
    <div class="row"></div>
    <div id="sky" class="col-sm-3" style="background-color:black;">The UK left the EU because they felt that their economy was strong</div>
<div class="col-sm-3" style="background-color:#ff3300;">The fact that they had to buy from other countries and sell them at a regulated price was causing them to lose money.</div>
   <div class="col-sm-3" style="background-color:#00ff00;">By not being part of the EU they could regulate the prices they sold items at</div>
    <div class="col-sm-3" style="background-color:#ff00ff;">However, in doing this their economy fell causing them to lose 300 Million Dollars in a couple of hours.</div>
    <div id="sky" class="col-sm-3" style="background-color:black;"> When they left the EU, the prices of goods they had to buy at went up since they weren't part of the EU.</div>
<div class="col-sm-3" style="background-color:#ff3300;">They would also have to pay a tax to further increase the price.</div>
   <div class="col-sm-3" style="background-color:#00ff00;">The costs could cause the UK to go banrupt as the amount of the pound when down</div>
    <div class="col-sm-3" style="background-color:#ff00ff;">The Uk had their reasons to doing this but the consequences outweigh the good things that came out of this</div>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>

    <p>Do you agree with the Uk's decision?</p>
